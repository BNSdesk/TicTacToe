### **NOUGHTS AND CROSSES**
Tic Tac Toe is known by a few other names around the world. The most common of these is "Noughts and Crosses" and it is sometimes simply referred to as the "XO game."

### **RULES**
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and fun game for 2 players, X and O. It is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player's goal is to make 3 in a row.

Players take turns placing their mark, X or O, on an open square in the grid. The first player to make 3 of their own mark in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is considered a Tie.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a zero-sum game, which means that if both players are playing their best, the game will end in a Tie. However, if you learn how to play tic-tac-toe and master some simple strategies, then you'll be able to not only play, but to win the majority of the time.
